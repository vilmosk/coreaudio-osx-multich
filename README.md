# coreaudio-osx-multich
Playing multichannel audio on a multichannel audio device

This git repo contains steps to set up a coreaduio augraph in order to be able to deliver multi channel audio to a multi channel audio device.

This helps you to suck less, and probably get stuff done faster.
I am leaving here some of my comments and lessons learned for anyone interested in core audio (the most undocumented but quite awesomly working beast from Apple).

Shout-out to the #coreaudio channel on irc.freenode.org, specifacally to nrk, with helping me getting through this.
Also thanks for the #swift-lang channel on the freenode, with some quick tips regarding to the language.

I'd highly advise to read the "Learning Core Audio" from Chris Adamson, Kevin Avila. It's an ok book, and you'll get the most of the concepts out of it.
The books examples are rewritten using swift, which can be a huge help if you do your dev in that language( you should, I like it a lot ), those can be found here: https://github.com/AlesTsurko/LearningCoreAudioWithSwift2.0.git

More to come...
